# Parameters vs. Arguments

- **Parameters** are the variable names specified within the parentheses `()` of a function definition. They serve as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function.
- **Arguments** are the actual values supplied to a function when it is invoked.
- Within the function body, parameters behave as local variables that are initialized with the provided arguments.

# Local Variables

- Variables declared inside a function in JavaScript are considered **local variables**.
- Local variables are created when the function is executed and are removed once the function has finished running.
