- Object
    - Method
    - Property

It is a common practice to declare objects, array, function, RegExp with the `const` keyword.


- Primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods
- Primitive values are immutable
- Objects are mutable.
- `const x = person` here the object x is not a copy of person. The object x **is** person.
- The object x and the object person share the same memory address.

# Object Constructor
- Constructor function names should be in PascalCase.
- The value of `this` in Constructor Function will become the new object when a new object is created.
