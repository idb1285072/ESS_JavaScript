# Scope

There are three types of scopes in JavaScript.

- **Global Scope**
  - Variables declared outside any function or block are globally scoped.
  - Accessible anywhere in the script.
- **Function Scope**
  - Variables declared with `var` inside a function are scoped to that function only.
- **Block Scope**
  - Variables declared with `let` or `const` inside `{}` are limited to that block.
