# **Master-Level Learning Roadmap for JavaScript Classes**

---

## 1. **Basic Class Syntax & Features**

* Class declaration and expressions
* Constructor method and initialization
* Instance methods
* Static methods and properties
* Getters and setters
* Using `this` inside classes
* Class fields (public and private)

---

## 2. **Prototypes & Classes**

* Understand how JS classes are **syntactic sugar** over prototypal inheritance
* How instance methods are stored on `.prototype`
* Difference between instance and static methods at the prototype level

---

## 3. **Inheritance**

* `extends` keyword to create subclasses
* Using `super()` to call parent constructors and methods
* Overriding parent class methods
* `instanceof` operator and prototype chain understanding

---

## 4. **Private & Protected Fields (Advanced)**

* Private fields with `#` syntax
* Private methods
* Limitations of private fields
* Use cases for encapsulation and data hiding

---

## 5. **Mixins and Multiple Inheritance Patterns**

* Implementing mixins with classes
* Composing behaviors from multiple sources
* Avoiding pitfalls of multiple inheritance

---

## 6. **Static Properties and Methods**

* How static members differ from instance members
* Use cases for utility/helper functions as static methods
* Static private fields (recent ECMAScript proposals)

---

## 7. **Class Expressions & Named Class Expressions**

* Anonymous vs named class expressions
* Differences and when to use each

---

## 8. **Advanced Patterns & Concepts**

* Using classes with `Symbol` properties (e.g., `Symbol.iterator`)
* Making classes iterable or thenable (Promises)
* Extending built-in classes like `Array`, `Error`, `Map`
* Meta-programming with classes (Proxy, Reflect)

---

## 9. **Decorators (Experimental / Stage-2 proposal)**

* How decorators work with classes and properties
* Using decorators for method/property modification or metadata

---

## 10. **Memory & Performance Considerations**

* How methods on prototype save memory
* Avoid creating methods inside constructor
* Optimizing class-heavy applications

---

## 11. **Integration with Modules & Modern JS**

* ES6 Modules and classes together
* Tree shaking and dead code elimination of unused classes
* Using classes with async/await and Promises

---

## 12. **Practical Projects & Challenges**

* Build complex class hierarchies (e.g., UI components, data models)
* Implement design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer) using classes
* Refactor prototype-based code into class-based code
* Unit testing classes (mocking and stubbing methods)
