## `==` loose equality vs `===` strict equality

- `==` (Loose Equality)
  - Performs type coercion
  - Tries to convert operands to the same type before comparing
  - Can lead to unexpected results
- `===` (Strict Equality)
  - No type coercion
  - Compares both value and type
  - Preferred in Modern JavaScript
